# Daily Dilbert
Simple scraper that picks up the day's Dilbert comic strip and sends it to an email list.

### It is finally here on Github!
I had promised to open-source the script 4 years ago, yet somehow never got around to do that, until tonight. What better scene that a hot and lonely Thursday night.

### Can you actually do this?
Probably not. Scraping is never really a good idea, and could easily break whenever something changes server-side.

### Why, then?
Same reason dogs eat their own turd - nobody knows.

### Can I...?
Knock yourself out. This is all MIT-licensed.

### Wait, how do I use this?
